# Object-Oriented Programming (II)

## Type inheritance

> Type inheritance refers to the mechanism of data types being derived from a base data type. All classes _inherit_ the base `object` type.

> Since typescript is just a wrapper for javascript, and typescript code is compiled to javascript, the underlying data type of any class is still `object`.
